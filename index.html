      <p>
        I want you to play a little flash-game called ESCAPE. ESCAPE is a pretty simple but addicting game. You only have to use one button, the escape key and you are climbing a tower.
      </br></br>
        You have 5 tries to come as far as possible. After your 5th try I want you to write down your best score and fill in the form, that is linked below.
